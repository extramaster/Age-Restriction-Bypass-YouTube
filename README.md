Age Restriction Bypass for YouTube™
===================================
Fast track viewing YouTube videos! - Bypass unfair Age Restrictions set by YouTube

## Introduction
This is the Open Source companion to the released extension: [Age Restriction Bypass for YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/age-restriction-bypass-fo/idcgcddddikdniemhklllnbillohblpn?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog). A YouTube demo of the extension in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oJnIILaEco and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkugVsgEw4

The objective of this project is to allow for community support to build upon and improve upon this extension. Consequently - any pull requests will be welcomed. The only request is to make at least one contribution, and to add your name onto the MIT license found below, and in the lib.js file.

Most of the code is contained in the now commented lib.js file, which serves as the primary code executed each time you visit a blocked YouTube video.

## Why?

Most sites allow for a Yes/No prompt when visiting unsavoury or explicit content - an example of this is a site called "LiveLeak", which delivers an unfiltered reality beyond the news.

In the case of YouTube, an account over the age of 18 is required to watch a video that has been flagged by the community.

This prevents videos pertaining to controversial events from being shown to a wider audience, including those who do not have access to a YouTube account, or those who live in a country where researching the origins of unrest is critical to understanding the day's news.

The logic behind this extension is that it acts as an automatic "Yes" when asked to view explicit content, without the need of a YouTube account. Another reason is that flagged videos may be the result of the community perceiving the video as being controversial (and not explicit), which results in videos that would be otherwise safe to watch under the age of 18, and in the case of this extension, results in a one-time install/uninstall to view.
